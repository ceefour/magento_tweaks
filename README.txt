Useful tweaks for Magento Commerce, including:

 1. Set default checkout type to "Register"
 2. Set default Shipping Address same as Billing Address ("Ship to this address")
 3. Include Front page in Google Sitemap XML
 4. Exclude Home CMS page in Google Sitemap XML
 5. Exclude Enable Cookies page in Google Sitemap XML
 6. Redirect 301 Permanent from 'home' CMS page to front page
 7. Always use Full Product URLs (i.e. /category/product.html instead of /product.html)
 8. Related to Full Product URLs: Product Canonical URLs (when enabled) also reflect that setting.
 9. ...more to come.
